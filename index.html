        <h1><b>About</b></h1>
        <p>I started my programming journey a few years ago.  Diving into the
          free to use engines such as Unity and Unreal both of which have rekindled
          my drive to learn and create.  I strive to learn all I can about the
          process it takes to make games and how I can become better at what I do.
          This has given me an appreciation for the amount of work and effort it
          takes to come out with even the simplest projects let alone the large
          and complex ones.  My desire to create keeps me hungry for the knowledge
          I need to do my very best. I enjoy challenges since they push me to be
          better and I find that I learn more from my failures than I do from my
          successes.</p>
        <p>I have been looking into website development and after learning html,
          css, and JavaScript I have come to enjoy the design and visual possibilities
          they bring to the user. <a href="#projects">Below</a> is some of the projects I have worked on.</p>
